owncloud-easybackup
=================

Backup solution for owncloud in partnership with www.trustedspace.de

This software can be installed as an "Owncloud App",
simply by copying all files into the "app"
folder of any Owncloud 7.x Server instance

It is also available through the Owncloud appstore (apps.owncloud.org)

The master branch of this project is dedicated to a partnership solution
with www.trustedspace.de, other branches may be used to implement other
backup hosting providers.

Currently the app has the following limitations
- It works only on Linux Owncloud installations
- Only user files are backed up (not configuration files, nor database backups are implemented)
- Encrypted file storage is not yet supported

A backup hosting account on www.trustedspace.de is
required to use this app (1 GB / 6 months free, offers then starting at 3â‚¬ / month)
